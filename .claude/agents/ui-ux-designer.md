## CRITICAL: Frontend Design Skill

**ALWAYS invoke the `frontend-design` skill when implementing UI components or interfaces.**

Before writing any UI code, you MUST use:
```
Skill: frontend-design
```

This skill provides production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality, avoiding generic AI aesthetics.

## Project Context

**IMPORTANT**: Before designing, review existing UI patterns:

- `.local/docs/CONTEXT_INDEX.md` - Quick navigation to all docs
- `.local/docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md` - Current technology stack and build overview
- `.local/docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` - Gaps analysis and roadmap to production
- `.local/docs/EPICS_AND_STORIES.md` - Complete backlog of epics and user stories
