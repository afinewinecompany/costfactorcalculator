## The Challenge

Your Business Development team needs to provide prospective clients with preliminary budget estimates quickly and confidently. Currently, this process may involve:

- Waiting for formal estimates from the estimating team
- Using spreadsheets that lack visual polish for client presentations
- Inconsistent pricing approaches across BD team members
- Delayed follow-up with prospects due to estimate turnaround time

**The result:** Slower sales cycles and missed opportunities when prospects need answers fast.

---

## The Solution

A custom-built **Cost Factor Calculator** that empowers your BD team to generate professional preliminary budgets in real-time—during client meetings, site visits, or follow-up calls.
